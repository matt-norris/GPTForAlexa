GPTForAlexa

This repository contains a novel Alexa Skill implementation that integrates a GPT-based AI model served via a Flask backend. With this skill, Alexa will be capable of providing responses based on the GPT model's output, regardless of the intent triggered by the user's input.

Setup Guide

Prerequisites
Amazon Developer Account: You'll need this to host your custom Alexa Skill. Sign up here if you don't already have an account.
Flask: The backend server is built using Flask. Install it using pip:
shell
```
pip install flask
```
ngrok or similar tunneling service: This is used for exposing your local Flask server to the internet. Download ngrok here.
Step-by-Step Guide
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Start your Flask server that hosts the GPT model.
shell
```
python your_flask_app.py
```
Use ngrok to expose your local server to the internet. In a new terminal window, start ngrok on the same port as your Flask server (usually port 5000):
shell
```
./ngrok http 5000
```
Log into your Amazon Developer Console, navigate to the Alexa Skills Kit and click on "Create Skill".
Set the skill's name, default language, and choose the "Custom" model for "What do you want to build".
Paste the interaction model JSON from interactionModel.json (in this repository) into the JSON Editor under the "Interaction Model" tab on the developer console.
Navigate to "Endpoint" under "Build" and select "HTTPS" for service endpoint type. Paste the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and select the second option for "My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority". Save the endpoints.
Build the model.
On your Alexa device, say "Open [Your Skill Invocation Name]".
You should now be able to interact with your Alexa Skill and receive responses powered by the GPT model served by your Flask server.

Troubleshooting

If the Skill doesn't respond as expected, check the following:

Ensure the Flask server is running and accessible via the ngrok URL.
Check if the intent and slot names in your Alexa Developer Console match those in the code.
Ensure your Alexa device is connected to the internet and linked to the same Amazon account as your Developer Console.
